# <Challenge 1: Horiseon Accessibility Refactor>

## Description

In this project, a fictional company wanted their website refactored for search engine optimization and screen reader accessibility.
Completing this project involved implementing these refactors in addition to semantic language in both HTML and CSS.
It also featured opportunities to edit code for debugging and legibility purposes.
The finished product met parameters using code that was both simpler and more effective than the starting material.
In all, this project allowed me to demonstrate an understanding of HTML and CSS functionality and best practices.
